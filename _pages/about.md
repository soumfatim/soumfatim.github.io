I am Soumahoro Fanta, of Ivorian nationality and a lover of reading.  I am a humble, committed, adaptable, disciplined, hardworking, confident and above all respectful person. I am goal-oriented and take into account productivity and a job well done. My goal is to use computer technologies (Machine learning, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning , Computer Vision, Web Service, ...) to produce more intelligent applications that meet specific needs. I am currently enrolled in African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) which is sponsored by Google and Facebook(Meta) within the AIMS Institute. This program will be done soon.


I completed my MSc degree in mathematical sciences at the [African Institute of Mathematical Sciences-AIMS Senegal] (https://aims-senegal.org/). I am focused on Big Data and Finance, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing being the techniques and skills applied to various projects and problem solving. I am also an alumnus of [Université Nangui Abrogoua, Abidjan](https://univ-na.ci/) where I obtained my bachelor degree in computer science and a Bac +4 in MIAGE.  

Currently I am leveraging my machine learning and deep learning skills in applications in finance, natural language processing, and computer vision. I am passionate about research related to artificial intelligence in the fields of finance, health and agriculture. I have completed my thesis entitled "Parallelization of truth finding algorithms", supervised by Dr. Mouhamadou Lamine Ba (https://sites.google.com/a/uadb.edu.sn/mlba/). In this project, we carry out an in-depth study of these algorithms by classifying them into parallelizable and non-parallelizable algorithms. We have proposed a parallel version of the TruthFinder truth-finding algorithm (Yin and Al, 2008).

 I am available to collaborate on projects related to my above mentioned areas of interest. However, I am curious to apply my skills in any area as long as the problem is addressable and interpretable in the world of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
